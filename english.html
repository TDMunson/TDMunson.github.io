                        <h3>Defining Moments</h3>
                        <p>This project is about what defines the students.I wrote about my niece and we have a special bond and how she changed my life and my process of thinking. Here is my defining moments</p>
                        <p>  “1,2,3 push” “big breath one more time push” “you’re doing great” the doctor said “Congratulations” . At that moment I knew my life would forever change. On November 8,2013 Mia Chanelle Munson was born my niece, my rock , my world, my everything. This is how it all started! I found out my sister was pregnant in the month of february, everything was in a uproar because, we were trying to keep it a secret because we didn’t want my dad to find out. My sister was crying because she didn’t want my dad to know, and  because she was 17 and still in high school. My sister and my niece’s father had already made a decision of keeping the baby. my sister didn’t want anyone else in our family to know because, she thought they were going to judge her. In my opinion I don’t know why she would think that because most of the people  in our family had kids at a young age as well   
                        </p>
                        <p> When other family members found out my sister was pregnant they tried to persuade her to get an abortion because it would be too much for her and, because they knew how my dad would react. But my sister doesn’t believe in abortions, in her mind she was thinking since she had sex she should be responsible and take care of her baby, the only option she would consider was adoption but she didn’t want to do that either, she fell in love with her baby from the moment she found out she was becoming a mother. When my daddy found out Tierra (my sister) was pregnant he didn’t take that to lightley. He was so pissed off he told her she had to live with my mom but that didn’t last long because dad finally realize that it was a mistake and my father loves me and my sister so much, to the fact where he couldn’t live with himself knowing that she is in another state because, he raised us that's kind of like crushing a child’s dream. he knew that Tierra didn’t know anything about where my mom lived so he decided to let her back. I had mixed feelings about this whole situation because, now my dad didn’t trust me because she had gotten pregnant and I had resentment towards her for that because, now I couldn’t do anything. My dad restrained me from doing a lot of stuff, this caused me to become really sneaky because, I felt like I had to sneak and do things because my father would think I’m out having sex and I wasn’t. This was a shock to literally everyone that knew us because, my sister was the smart, active, cheerleader, dancer, flag tosser, independent daughter of every mother's dream. But I was happy for her. As the months went on my sister got bigger,bigger,bigger,and bigger. 
                        </p>
                        <p> On November 7 4:30 am me, my mom, and my 2 sisters traveled downtown to northwestern memorial hospital to induce my sister’s labor. We ate, slept, laughed and, repeat. On November 8 at 5:17 in the morning my sister gave birth to a healthy, beautiful, 7lb 9oz 22in. baby girl. I instantly fell in love because I finally found out why I was put on this earth.My niece has changed me in so many ways. Before Mia was born I used to do really bad things such as sneaking outside, I used to start trouble with other people that did absolutely nothing to me, I was filled with so much anger and madness that I could hurt anyone. But when my niece was born I feel like I became a whole new person, I didn’t do anything bad no more because, I felt like I had a reason to do and want better for myself because I had someone looking up to me.  As time went by not only did i watch this amazing baby become a  smart, hilarious, young independent, baby, But I’ve seen my sister mature and, blossom. Mia the joy of my world the light to darkness gave  me a reason to live and be happy. I have to show her to be a young lady when she gets older. Because whenever I’m down I  just look into her eyes, give her a big hug and kiss and, I know everything will be ok. Believe it or not she has changed me! Yes a 2 year old has changed me. I don’t do the things I used to anymore I think before I react. My life without her is like a teacher without knowledge, chicken with no season, prom with no king and queen. It just wouldn’t be right. 
                        </p>
                        <p> SHE IS MY EVERYTHING!

                        <h3>English Honors</h3>
                        <p>Honors was a option that I choosed to do.We had to create a paper that gave supportive evidence about the narriatve above. As well as what we wanted the reader to take away.</p>
                        <p>In my narrative I wanted the reader to be right there as is they were in the scene. The sentence in my article states “1,2,3 push” ” big breath one more time time push” “You’re doing great” “At that moment I knew my life would forever change”.This is where I wanted the reader to be in and picture what was happening and what was going on. I also wanted the reader to feel how hurt and upset my family and I were at this time I wanted the reader to feel how I felt about not being trusted because of my sister’s mistake. According to the passages it says “When other family members found out my sister was pregnant they tried to persuade her to get an abortion because it would be too much for her and, because they knew how my dad would react. But my sister doesn’t believe in abortions, in her mind she was thinking since she had sex she should be responsible and take care of her baby, the only option she would consider was adoption .When my daddy found out Tierra (my sister) was pregnant he didn’t take that to lightley. He was so pissed off he told her she had to live with my mom, now my dad didn’t trust me because she had gotten pregnant .My dad restrained me from doing a lot of stuff, this caused me to become really sneaky because, I felt like I had to sneak and do things because my father would think I’m out having sex and I wasn’t. This was a shock to literally everyone that knew us because, my sister was the smart, active, cheerleader, dancer, flag tosser, independent daughter of every mother's dream.” In this paragraph my supportive evidence would be how I felt and how this whole pregnancy and this had an effect to everyone. I would also like the reader to take away how much I disliked my sister for getting pregnant. In the second paragraph it states “ now my dad didn’t trust me because she had gotten pregnant and I had resentment towards her for that because, now I couldn’t do anything.” Another thing I would like the reader to take away from my narrative is how I used to be and how she changed my whole demeanor, personality ,and how I carry my self. The text clearly states “Before Mia was born I used to do really bad things such as sneaking outside, I used to start trouble with other people that did absolutely nothing to me, I was filled with so much anger and madness that I could hurt anyone. But when my niece was born I feel like I became a whole new person, I didn’t do anything bad no more because, I felt like I had a reason to do and want better for myself because I had someone looking up to me.” In the particular piece I wanted the reader to basically see my changes and how far I came. Almost like I wanted the reader to feel how passionate I was. My last and final take away that I reader to feel is how much I love my sister and niece and how she lifts me up when I’m down. The story states “  As time went by not only did i watch this amazing baby become a  smart, hilarious, young independent, baby, But I’ve seen my sister mature and, blossom. Mia the joy of my world the light to darkness gave  me a reason to live and be happy. I have to show her to be a young lady when she gets older. Because whenever I’m down I  just look into her eyes, give her a big hug and kiss and, I know everything will be ok. Believe it or not she has changed me! Yes a 2 year old has changed me. I don’t do the things I used to anymore I think before I react. My life without her is like a teacher without knowledge, chicken with no season, prom with no king and queen. It just wouldn’t be right. “ This Specific paragraph tells how much she has changed me and my love for not only my niece but my sister as well.
                       </p>
