                <p>Spanish is one of my most proudest because, this was a very hard subject to accomplish, considering the fact that I was never introduced into a different language other than english. But I managed to get though it and, this actually became one of my favorite subjects while in high school. Click here if you are interested into reading more about my spanish projects  </p>
